    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

Naive Bayes works well because of the independence assumption that aligns well with the bag of words approach where all the features are treated independently by only taking into account the frequencies of each word.

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

    "TfidfVectorizer is different from CountVectorizer because rather than taking occurance counts, which have issues with longer documents having higher average count values than shorter documents, the TfidfVectorizer divides the number of occurrences of each word in the document by the total number of words in the document to compute term frequencies.\n",

    "From looking at the confusion matrix, one possible issue the model struggles with is dealing with differentiating between alt.atheism and talk.religion.misc. This is evident by the earlier analysis of top words for each label where atheism had many words \"religion\" in it's top 5 features. Another issue is that transmission details such as FTP information confuse the model as well. One way to improve the model could be to remove all FTP or email information to reduce the noise leading to misclassifications as comp.graphics. Other options might be to use stop words to remove commonly used words or to look at using bigram words to improve overall accuracy."
